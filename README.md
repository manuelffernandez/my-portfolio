# Portfolio :rocket:
## What is about :question:

My personal portfolio source code. 

The project is intended to being developed keeping in mind a simple and intuitive interface. The objective is to showcase relevant information about my **profesional profile**, my **favorite projects** and **techs** that I learned during capacitation.

### Techs & libraries :wrench:
In order to keep this project as simple as possible, I integrate just a few libraries which are listed below

[<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dke7ynizq/image/upload/v1682985761/portfolio/icons/react_r2asdh.svg' alt='react icon'/>](https://react.dev/) React as main library to separate in reusable components and store simple states.


[<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dke7ynizq/image/upload/v1682985762/portfolio/icons/sass_z17qnd.svg' alt='sass icon'/>](https://sass-lang.com/) Sass for the styles. The color palette and design were created by me.

[<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dke7ynizq/image/upload/v1683067481/portfolio/icons/firebase_gziost.svg' alt='firebase icon' />](https://firebase.google.com/) Firebase to store the skills, objectives and projects data.

## Collaborate :handshake:
I invested a lot of time in the plan-creation process of my portfolio, and that's why I want to share it with you.

I know sometimes its hard to create a simple but pretty website, even if youtube is collapsed by Indian tutorials. But sometimes we want something that had our signature, and there is where this project cames.

So if you like this model and want to collaborate in some way or just simple use as a template to create yours, please feel free to do it.

**:smile: Just don't forget to mention :smile:**

## Installation

For this project I used v18.14.2 of NodeJS. There is a *.nvmrc* file to select the correct version with **nvm**. If you don't have it, ensure that you have installed that specific node version.

<sub>See [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for more info.</sub>

To get started clone the repository and run:

-  `npm i` or `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
-  `npm run dev` to launch the application in your browser.
